// entitlement-checked session - see src/routes/auth/access/+server.js for
// how that session gets created. SvelteKit has one server hook, not
// per-folder Pages Functions middleware (emu_print/Simulations' pattern),
// so the equivalent guard lives here instead of a _middleware.js per
// subtree.
//
// NOT actually every route, despite the above: wrangler.toml's [assets]
// block has no `run_worker_first`, so Cloudflare serves everything under
// static/ (the compiled JS bundle, the v86 WASM runtime, lab datasets
// under static/data/) directly at the edge, without this hook ever
// running - see that file's own comment. Safe only because that content
// is public curriculum data and a public-domain emulator binary, never
// anything that should require a session. Any future lab dataset needs
// checking against that assumption before landing under static/data/.
